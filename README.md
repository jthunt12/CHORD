# CHORD_Protocol

The following is my implementation of simulating CHORD.
    
    The project was made using Python.
    Most comments should provide my thought process.
    
    There were a few instances were an infinite loop was found. 
    To prevent this a catch was created to move the algorithm to an exhaustive search.
    
    ** I had the best luck when using 10-12 nodes for the diagram and giving "B" a value of 5 or 6
