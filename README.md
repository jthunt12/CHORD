# CHORD

The following program simulates the CHORD (peer-to-peer) protocol.
     
     In Computer Networking, CHORD is a protocol and algorithm used to predict a peer-to-peer distributed hash table.
     A distributed hash table stores key-value pairs by assigning keys to different computers (known as "nodes")
     A node will store the values for all the keys for which it is responsible.
     
     Chord specifies how keys are assigned to nodes, and how a node can discover the value for a given key 
     by first locating the node responsible for that key.

## Example Output 
** I had the best luck when using 10-12 nodes for the diagram and giving "B" a value of 5 or 6
